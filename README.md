# EEE-212-Microcontroller
This is a project for EEE-212 lecture. I created this project by my own. In this project I used some sensors like HC-SR 04, buzzer, RGB led and 16*2 LCD screen. This project is written with C++. Basically it is a lighthouse which measures the distance and set alert if some objects get closer.
